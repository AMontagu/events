# Conferences

Here you will find conferences that have a specific focus on Vue.js. This means that we will post all Vue Conferences as well as any with a dedicated track or focus on Vue.js. So while other frontend conferences may have speakers speaking about Vue.js, they will not be included here to keep the focus on conferences with a lot of Vue.js content.
